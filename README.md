How to Interact with the Stream
-------------------------------

You can interact with the live stream and control the camera views using specific commands in the YouTube chat. This allows you to explore different areas of Burke Farm and focus on the aspects of nature you find most interesting.

### Camera Switching Commands (`!switchto`)

Use `!switchto` to switch between different cameras. We currently have three cameras set up: "deercrossing", "birdfeeder", and "bridge". To switch to a specific camera, use the command followed by the camera name.

**Examples:**

*   `!switchto deercrossing` - Switches the view to the "Deer Crossing" camera.
*   `!switchto birdfeeder` - Switches the view to the "Bird Feeder" camera.
*   `!switchto bridge` - Switches the view to the "Bridge" camera.

### PTZ Control Commands (`!ptz`)

The `!ptz` command allows you to control the Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) functions of the currently broadcasted camera. Each camera has preset PTZ locations numbered starting from 000. Use these commands to move the camera to these preset locations.

**Examples:**

*   `!ptz preset 002` - Moves the current camera to preset location 002.

The chatbot will confirm the action with a response like:

*   "Moved camera 'deercrossing' to PTZ preset: 002 - Deer Creek Crossing"

### Using Preset Names

In addition to using preset numbers (e.g., 000, 001, 002), you can also reference a PTZ preset by its name. This is case-insensitive and allows for a more intuitive way to control the cameras.

**Example:**

*   `!ptz preset fox area` - Moves the camera to the preset location named "Fox Area."
*   `!ptz preset deer creek crossing` - Moves the current camera to the "Deer Creek Crossing" preset location.
